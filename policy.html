                        personal account on the Platform. This service is provided by the domain name registrar LLC
                        Domains Registrar REG.RU. All personal data required for domain registration shall be processed
                        and stored in accordance with their User Agreement and Privacy Policy. The Platform does not
                        process this requested data; it solely provides the user interface for transferring personal
                        data to the domain registrar. <br> 3. The way Personal Data is collected <br> The main ways of
                        receiving personal information from Users:<br><br>a) User provides personal information directly
                        (e.g., when registering on the Platform or using a payment system);<br>b) Personal Data is
                        collected automatically when the User looks through or uses the Platform, for example with the
                        help of cookie files (see more in the Cookie Policy);<br>c) A user can provide Personal Data on
                        their own accord why they sign into and use third party services integrated wilfully while they
                        assign and use of third-parties services that are integrated into the Platform. <br> 4. Personal
                        Data Use <br> The Administration may use Personal Data provided to it by the User to:<br><br>a)
                        Create an Account and Personal account in order to use the Platform;<br>b) Provide client
                        service and technical support;<br>c) Send notices by email, such as confirmation of
                        registration, a reminder and a notice about a forthcoming or completed payment, activation of
                        the trial period and notification of its termination, complaints about the Site created within
                        the Account, notices about significant changes in client service. These messages are mandatory
                        from technical point of view and cannot be canceled for an active account.<br>d) Email
                        educational materials regarding using the Platform and monthly newsletters containing news
                        connected with the Platform's functions. To opt out from receiving these messages, the User must
                        follow the unsubscribe instruction which is contained in every message they receive.<br>e)
                        Provide tailored service. For example, location and language detected by the browser are used to
                        set the language of the Platform's interface.<br>f) Send promotional materials and advertising.
                        Depending on how the User engages with the Platform, they may be sent individual marketing
                        messages about products and services. Also the information about user interaction with the
                        Platform allows it to recalibrate advertising campaigns, for example, avoid showing social ads
                        to the Platform's users.<br>g) Integrate third party services that provide additional
                        functionalities to the User's website that have been added by the use voluntarily and on their
                        own accord.<br>h) Sending notifications of payments made on the User's website.<br>i) Improve
                        the function of the Platform and provide better services. Statistics and analysis about the use
                        of the Platform's functions allows us to determine the priorities for further development. As a
                        result, for this purpose anonymous generalized information is used. <br> 5. Transfer of personal
                        data to third parties <br> The User may be required to provide Personal Data by third party
                        services, for example, to make a transaction or integrate third-party services that give
                        additional features to the User's website. The User provides this information voluntarily and on
                        their own accord. All personal data required by third party services shall be processed and
                        stored in accordance with their User Agreement and Privacy Policy.<br><br> The Administration
                        can share personal data with service providers that perform services on the Administration's
                        behalf. For example, the Administration can use third parties to help it provide customer
                        support, manage advertising, send notifications and newsletters on the Administration's behalf.
                        These third parties are prohibited from using the Users' personal data for promotional
                        purposes.<br><br> The Administration can disclose personal data if required by within the limits
                        of the law or to protect rights and interests if this disclosure is reasonably needed to comply
                        with the law or to prevent fraud. In particular, the Administration can disclose the User's data
                        if it is lawfully requested by state authorities or if it receives a justified claim addressed
                        to the User about the violation of the Third parties' rights and/or the User Agreement.<br><br>
                        The Administration can share the User's personal data with third parties to provide the User
                        with targeted advertising, and also to measure and control its effectiveness. For example, the
                        Administration can use encrypted emails to adjust advertising in social networks to avoid
                        showing these ads to current Platform users. <br> 6. Storage of data <br> The processing and
                        storage of the User's personal data will be carried out lawfully during the time that the
                        account exists. In the event that the account is deleted, some data may be stored insofar as it
                        is necessary for fulfilling legal obligations, settling disputes, preventing fraud and
                        protecting the interests of the Administration.<br><br> The Administration takes all necessary
                        technical and organizational precautions to protect User's personal data against unauthorized or
                        accidental access, deletion or alteration, blocking, copying, disclosure or other unauthorized
                        actions of third parties.<br><br> In case of loss or disclosure of User's personal data the
                        Administration notices the User about the fact of his personal data loss or disclosure. <br> 7.
                        Personal Data collected by Users on their websites <br> 6.1. General provisions<br><br>The
                        Administration does not process personal data collected by the User on websites, and only
                        provides the computing capacity that could be used for data collection. The Administration is
                        not a 'Controller' but a 'Processor', according to the terminology defined in the European Union
                        General Data Protection Regulation.<br><br> Data collected on the User's website is kept in
                        their personal account for 30 days. This function is included by default and is aimed at
                        improving user experience. The User is free to switch off this function at any time, change the
                        amount of time their data is retained, change or delete data either in part or in full, and also
                        to export data.<br><br> In the event the User uses an online payment system, the Administration
                        may receive partial data about a successful payment in order to facilitate cooperation between
                        the website and payment system.<br><br> The function of logging and retaining partial
                        information about a successful payment is included by default. This function can be set by the
                        User in their personal account. The User may change the length of time their data is kept or
                        turn off this function.<br><br><br>6.2. Responsibility of the User<br><br> Should the User
                        process third party data, the User is solely liable for taking appropriate measures for the
                        protection of personal data, according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
                        other laws and regulations, including obtaining appropriate permits and posting the necessary
                        documentation and information to their website.<br><br> The Administration does not have the
                        right to provide legal assistance to Users, although we recommend that the Users who process
                        personal data, add a User Agreement to their website, as well as the confidentiality agreement
                        and in the data collection form add links to these documents and a special field that will show
                        that the User has read and given consent to these rules. Read more about this in the Help
                        section of our Platform: <a
                            href="http://help.tilda.ws/gdpr-compliance">help.tilda.ws/gdpr-compliance<br></a>The site
                        created by the User uses cookie files by default. In case if the User has no plans to use this
                        function or work with personal data, they must disable the use of cookies in the site settings.
                        <br> <br> 8. Cookie Policy <br> Cookies are small text files sent by the server to the user's
                        device. Cookies perform many functions, for example, they allow to save the settings made by the
                        user, allow the user to move between pages after signing in and, on the whole, make working on a
                        website easier.<br><br> Here's how we are using cookie files:<br> а) Identification — cookie
                        files allow website providers to recognise your advice and your Account so they don't have to
                        request your login details and password every time you go to another page;<br> b) Analytics —
                        cookie files allow us to obtain information about the viewing how many times this or that page
                        was viewed.<br><br> The user has the right to set the browser to refuse cookies but this will
                        substantially limit their ability to the Platform. <br> 9. Managing personal data <br> The User
                        can review, change or delete Personal data that was provided by the User or that was collected
                        from the User's website, in their personal account or by sending a relevant query by emailing <a
                            href="mailto:legal@tilda.cc">legal@tilda.cc</a>.The User may use the same email address
                        should the User request for their online Account to be deleted.<br><br> For technical reasons,
                        the information may not be deleted straight away, but after a delay. Please note that we may
                        retain some of the information to the extent that is necessary for fulfilling legal obligations,
                        resolving disputes, preventing fraud and protecting the legitimate interests of the
                        Administration. <br> 10. User's obligations <br> In relation of the User to the Administration,
                        the User provides their personal data and keeps it current.<br><br> The User shall independently
                        manage relationships with their Users in relation to the data collected on the User's website.
                        <br> 11. Administration obligations <br> The Administration undertakes to:<br><br> a) Use the
                        information provided exclusively for the purposes set out in the Clause 4 of the present Privacy
